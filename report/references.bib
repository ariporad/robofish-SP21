	abstract = {Identifying and safely navigating submerged obstacles in shallow waters is a difﬁcult task as common navigation technologies based on acoustic sensing systems are not efﬁcient in littoral zones[5]. Developing a vehiclemounted active 3D reconstruction (structured light) imaging system that can be used for real-time obstacle detection and avoidance is now a viable approach to solving littoral navigation due to its affordability. Structured light has been researched and demonstrated as an object reconstruction technique, with particular focus on three-dimensional mapping and scanning[6]. Although it has been successfully applied to object reconstruction, utilizing the structured light data as an input to the on-board navigation stack has not yet been extensively tested. As a proven solution for highly accurate object reconstruction, the application of structured light to obstacle avoidance provides promise for improved vehicle navigation in littoral waters.},

Gray code patterns are projected onto the object surface by a {DMD} projection device and a {CCD} camera captures the distorted pattern images. For the purpose of precision measurement, a 3D mathematical model is proposed for the system and a calibration process is developed to obtain system parameters. The pattern is encoded with a unique {ID} and correspondence pairs between the {CCD} and {DMD} can be found. The surface proﬁle can be computed by the calibrated model. In order to acquire higher measurement resolution, we propose a correspondence matching method which combines Gray codes encoding and sub-pixel edge detection. With a line-shifting procedure, the measurement resolution is elevated four times higher. Experiment results demonstrate the system has measurement area of 12 · 9 mm2, with lateral resolution about 10 lm and vertical resolution about 3 lm.},

	abstract = {The digital micromirror device, or {DMD}, is the  microoptoelectromechanical system ({MOEMS}) that is the core of the trademarked {DLP} projection technology from Texas Instruments ({TI}). Texas Instrument's {DMD} was created by solid state physicist and {TI} Fellow Emeritus Dr. Larry Hornbeck in 1987. However, the technology goes back to 1973 with Harvey C. Nathanson's (inventor of {MEMS} c. 1965) use of millions of microscopically small moving mirrors to create a video display of the type now found in digital projectors.The {DMD} project began as the deformable mirror device in 1977 using micromechanical analog light modulators.  The first analog {DMD} product was the {TI} {DMD}2000 airline ticket printer that used a {DMD} instead of a laser scanner.
A {DMD} chip has on its surface several hundred thousand microscopic mirrors arranged in a rectangular array which correspond to the pixels in the image to be displayed. The mirrors can be individually rotated ±10-12°, to an on or off state. In the on state, light from the projector bulb is reflected into the lens making the pixel appear bright on the screen. In the off state, the light is directed elsewhere (usually onto a heatsink), making the pixel appear dark.
To produce greyscales, the mirror is toggled on and off very quickly, and the ratio of on time to off time determines the shade produced (binary pulse-width modulation). Contemporary {DMD} chips can produce up to 1024 shades of gray (10 bits). See Digital Light Processing for discussion of how color images are produced in {DMD}-based systems.

The mirrors themselves are made out of aluminum and are around 16 micrometers across. Each one is mounted on a yoke which in turn is connected to two support posts by compliant torsion hinges. In this type of hinge, the axle is fixed at both ends and twists in the middle. Because of the small scale, hinge fatigue is not a problem      and tests have shown that even 1 trillion (1012) operations do not cause noticeable damage. Tests have also shown that the hinges cannot be damaged by normal shock and vibration, since it is absorbed by the {DMD} superstructure.
Two pairs of electrodes control the position of the mirror by electrostatic attraction. Each pair has one electrode on each side of the hinge, with one of the pairs positioned to act on the yoke and the other acting directly on the mirror. The majority of the time, equal bias charges are applied to both sides simultaneously. Instead of flipping to a central position as one might expect, this actually holds the mirror in its current position. This is because attraction force on the side the mirror is already tilted towards is greater, since that side is closer to the electrodes.
To move the mirrors, the required state is first loaded into an {SRAM} cell located beneath each pixel, which is also connected to the electrodes. Once all the {SRAM} cells have been loaded, the bias voltage is removed, allowing the charges from the {SRAM} cell to prevail, moving the mirror. When the bias is restored, the mirror is once again held in position, and the next required movement can be loaded into the memory cell.
The bias system is used because it reduces the voltage levels required to address the pixels such that they can be driven directly from the {SRAM} cell, and also because the bias voltage can be removed at the same time for the whole chip, so every mirror moves at the same instant. The advantages of the latter are more accurate timing and a more cinematic moving image.

The described failure mode on these is caused by internal contamination usually due to seal failure corroding the mirror supports.
A related failure is glue used between 2007 and 2013 which under heat and light degrades and outgasses: this normally causes fogging
inside the glass and eventually white/black pixels.
This cannot usually be repaired but defective {DMD} chips can sometimes be used for less critical projects not needing rapidly changing patterns if the existing bad pixels can be made part of the projected image or otherwise mapped out, including 3D scanning.},

	abstract = {High precision measurements of nearly flat highly reflective surfaces present many problems when using a phase-measuring Fizeau interferometer. Since a coated reference surface is required to yield good fringe contrast with a high reflectance test surface, the interference fringes are likely to deviate from being perfectly sinusoidal. Utilizing phase-measurement algorithms that take data over a 2-wavelength range of phase shifter motion can help reduce the effects of errors due to nonsinusoidal fringes. If linear and 2nd-order phase shifter errors are present, the greater number of frames of fringe data can aid in making a better estimate of the phase. Eight algorithms that have been published in the literature are compared using simulations and experimental measurements. From this study, it was determined that a 12-frame algorithm having 600 (/3) phase shifts developed by Surrel had superior performance when used with a Clapham-Dew type coated reference surface and a high reflectance test surface. Residual errors in the phase calculation were found to be reducible to a few thousandths of a wave peak-to-valley.},

Due to the large nonlinearities present in a camera and laser diodes, large range distances become diﬃcult to measure with high precision. Aiming to improve the precision and accuracy of the range measurement sensor based on laser triangulation, a calibration model is proposed that involves the parameters of the camera, lens, laser positions, and sensor position on the robot arm related to the robot base to ﬁnd the best accuracy in the distance range of the application. The developed sensor is composed of a {CMOS} camera and two laser diodes that project light lines onto the blade surface and needs image processing to ﬁnd the 3D coordinates. The distances vary from 250 to 650 mm and the accuracy obtained within the distance range is below 1 mm. The calibration process needs a previous camera calibration and special calibration boards to calculate the correct distance between the laser diodes and the camera. The sensor position ﬁxed on the robot arm is found by moving the robot to selected positions. The experimental procedures show the success of the calibration scheme.},
